<h1 align="center">Monte-Carlo-simulation-in-Julia.</h1>

<p align="center">In this project, we use Julia, a high-level, high-performance programming language for technical computing, to create a Monte Carlo simulation. The primary goal is to numerically calculate an approximate value of the constant Pi (ùúã), following the algorithm available on Wikipedia.</p>
